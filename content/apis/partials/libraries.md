# Quick Start

Welcome to **Trader4**! 🎉 We understand how important it is to stay connected with your customers, and that's why we offer SDKs that make it easy, fast and safe to connect to our products and services via APIs. So don't wait, get connected today! 🤝

::: tip Mock API Server
For testing and development, you can use our [Mock API Server](https://docs.trader4.net/v1/oauth/sign.json) to simulate the API responses.
Every method is available on the Mock API Server, and you can use it to test your integration without making any real API calls.
You can add `.json` to the end of any API endpoint to get a JSON response. For example, `https://docs.trader4.net/v1/oauth/sign.json` will return a JSON response.
